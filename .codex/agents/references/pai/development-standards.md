# Development Standards (Normalized)

## Working Style
- Start by clarifying scope and acceptance criteria.
- Plan before implementation when work is non-trivial.
- Keep changes small and focused.
- Prefer readability and maintainability over clever abstractions.

## Implementation Discipline
- Keep interfaces explicit.
- Remove dead code instead of leaving stale paths.
- Avoid hidden side effects.
- Document non-obvious decisions succinctly.

## Quality Controls
- Run strongest available local checks.
- Verify behavior in realistic runtime conditions.
- Report unresolved risks and follow-up work.
