# PAI Foundations (Normalized)

This reference captures the shared foundations used across migrated roles.

## Core Principles
- Focus on user outcomes first.
- Prefer simple, verifiable solutions over speculative complexity.
- Keep decisions explicit: assumptions, constraints, tradeoffs, and non-goals.
- Favor deterministic workflows and reproducible validation.

## Engineering Orientation
- Treat correctness, security, and maintainability as first-class.
- Use structured planning for non-trivial work.
- Align implementation choices with realistic operating constraints.

## Stack Orientation
- Prefer TypeScript and Bun in JS/TS ecosystems unless project conventions differ.
- Respect existing repository standards when they already exist.

## Delivery Expectations
- Evidence-based claims only.
- Cite concrete commands, files, and validation outputs.
- Explicitly separate confirmed facts from assumptions.
