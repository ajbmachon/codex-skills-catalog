# Stack Integrations (Normalized)

## Default Preferences
- TypeScript-first for JS ecosystems.
- Bun-first for JS/TS command execution where compatible.
- Use project-native tools if a repo already standardizes alternatives.

## Integration Guidance
- Follow existing project conventions for module structure and naming.
- Keep compatibility boundaries explicit when introducing new components.
- Validate performance and reliability assumptions with concrete checks.
