# CompareModels Workflow (Codex)

1. Run identical suite/tasks across candidate models.
2. Keep transcript/output capture method constant.
3. Compare:
- pass rate
- mean score
- score variance
- cost/latency (if tracked externally)
4. Choose production model + fallback model and document rationale.
