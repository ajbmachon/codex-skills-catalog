## Purpose & Cognitive Work

**What this mode does:** Take an existing approach, process, or belief—decompose it to its atomic components—question each atom—then rebuild from only what's still true.

**The mental model:** If you're building a tower of blocks, most of us inherit the tower already built. We might rearrange blocks, add blocks, or polish blocks. First principles says: knock it down, examine each block, throw out the rotten ones, then rebuild.

**The cognitive challenge for you (Claude):** The temptation is to decompose to components but then rebuild in the same pattern. True first principles requires you to forget the original structure and ask: "If I only knew these atoms, what would I build?"

**The question behind this mode:** "If we started from scratch today, knowing only the fundamental truths, would we build it this way?"

---

## Why First Principles is Rare and Powerful

### Why It's Rare
1. **Cognitively expensive:** Questioning everything takes effort; accepting inherited wisdom is easy
2. **Socially risky:** Challenging "how we've always done it" creates conflict
3. **Often unnecessary:** For most decisions, heuristics and best practices work fine
4. **Requires courage:** First principles sometimes leads to uncomfortable conclusions

### Why It's Powerful
1. **Escapes local maxima:** The current approach might be the best *within its constraints*—but the constraints might be false
2. **Finds novel solutions:** By releasing inherited assumptions, you see options that were invisible
3. **Identifies obsolete constraints:** Many "rules" come from constraints that no longer exist
4. **Creates genuine innovation:** Rearranging existing ideas = incremental improvement. Rebuilding from atoms = potential breakthrough

### When to Use It
- "Best practices" feel stale but no one questions them
- The current approach made sense once but the world has changed
- Competitors are all doing similar things (opportunity to break out)
- You're stuck in a local optimum and need fresh perspective
- Someone says "that's just how it's done"

---

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Identify the Subject
What belief, process, or approach are we examining? Be specific:
- Not "our marketing" → "our content marketing strategy targeting enterprise CTOs"
- Not "how we work" → "our weekly team meeting format"

### Phase 2: Decompose to Atoms
Break down the current approach into its component assumptions and beliefs. Keep asking "why" until you hit bedrock—claims that can't be decomposed further.

### Phase 3: Question Each Atom
For each atomic claim, ask:
- Is this actually true?
- What evidence supports it?
- Under what conditions would it be false?
- Why do we believe this?

### Phase 4: Validate or Discard
For each atom, decide:
- **Valid:** This is genuinely true and we have evidence
- **Expired:** This was true but conditions have changed
- **Never true:** This was assumed but never validated
- **Partially true:** True in some contexts but not universally

### Phase 5: Reconstruct
Starting ONLY with the valid atoms, ask: What would we build? Don't try to rebuild the original—let the atoms lead where they lead.

### Phase 6: Compare
How does the reconstruction differ from the original? What does that tell us?

---

## The Decomposition Phase

### Finding the Atoms

An **atom** is a belief that can't be decomposed further into sub-beliefs. It's a foundational claim.

**Example decomposition:**

Starting point: "We need a sales team to sell our product"

Level 1: Why?
→ "Because customers need to be persuaded to buy"

Level 2: Why?
→ "Because the value isn't immediately obvious"

Level 3: Why?
→ "Because our product is complex"

Level 4: Why?
→ "Because enterprise software requires customization"

**Atoms found:**
- Enterprise software requires customization (is this true?)
- Our product is complex (is this necessary?)
- Value isn't immediately obvious (could it be?)
- Customers need persuasion (is there an alternative?)
- Persuasion requires humans (or could it be automated?)

### The "Why" Chain

Keep asking "why" until you get to one of:
1. **Physical law:** Gravity, thermodynamics, etc. (true)
2. **Human nature:** People are lazy/busy/scared/etc. (probably true)
3. **Arbitrary choice:** "That's just how we set it up" (question this)
4. **Historical constraint:** "We did it this way because of X" (is X still true?)
5. **Unexamined assumption:** "Everyone does it this way" (question this)

---

## The Questioning Phase

### Questions for Each Atom

**Existence:**
- Is this actually true, or do we just believe it's true?
- What's the evidence?
- Who says this is true, and why would they know?

**Necessity:**
- Does this HAVE to be true, or is it just how things currently are?
- Under what conditions would this not be true?
- Is this true everywhere, or only in our context?

**Origin:**
- Why do we believe this?
- When did we start believing it?
- What was the original reason—does that reason still apply?

**Currency:**
- Is this still true, or was it true in the past?
- What has changed since this became a belief?
- If we learned this truth today, would we still believe it?

### Red Flags in Your Atoms

**"Everyone knows..."** → Question it. Widespread belief ≠ truth.

**"We've always..."** → Why? What were the original constraints? Do they still exist?

**"You can't..."** → Says who? Is this physical impossibility or just convention?

**"Best practice is..."** → Whose practice? Best for what? When was this decided?

---

## The Reconstruction Phase

### The Clean Slate Rule

**Critical:** When reconstructing, do not look at the original approach. Work only from your validated atoms.

Why: The original approach exerts gravitational pull. If you keep glancing at it, you'll unconsciously rebuild something similar. The power of first principles is escaping that gravity.

### Reconstruction Questions

Given only these atoms, and starting from scratch today:
- What's the simplest approach that satisfies these truths?
- What would I build if I had no legacy to maintain?
- What would a competitor with no history do?
- What would I do if I were 10x constrained on resources?
- What would I do if I had 10x the resources?

### The Novel Solution

If your reconstruction looks very similar to the original, you may have:
- Kept too many atoms (some should have been discarded)
- Failed to truly question the atoms
- Unconsciously preserved the original structure

True first principles often produces something that looks quite different.

## Shallow vs Deep First Principles

### Shallow (What to Avoid)

```
Subject: Our weekly team meeting

Current approach: 1-hour Monday standup

Decomposition:
- We need to communicate
- Weekly is a good cadence
- Monday is the start of the week
- An hour is enough time

Reconstruction: Keep the meeting but maybe do 45 minutes
```

**Why it's shallow:**
- "Decomposition" is just listing features, not finding atoms
- Questions weren't genuinely asked
- Reconstruction is tweaking, not rebuilding
- No insight generated

### Deep (What to Aim For)

```
Subject: Our weekly team meeting

Current approach: 1-hour Monday standup

Decomposition:
- "We need to communicate" → WHY? → So everyone knows what others are doing → WHY? → To avoid duplicate work and blockers → WHY synchronously? → Because async didn't exist / wasn't trusted

  ATOM: Avoiding duplicate work and blockers requires shared awareness

- "Weekly is good cadence" → WHY? → Matches sprint cadence → WHY that cadence? → Inherited from Scrum → WHY? → Scrum was designed for co-located teams

  ATOM: Work should be reviewed at a cadence matching its cycle time

- "Everyone attends" → WHY? → So no one is out of the loop → WHY does that require attendance? → Because information shared verbally isn't captured → IS THAT NECESSARY?

  ATOM: Information sharing requires a reliable propagation mechanism

Atom Validation:
- "Shared awareness needed" → VALID
- "Cadence should match cycle time" → VALID (but our cycle time isn't weekly—it's 2-3 days)
- "Verbal = primary mechanism" → EXPIRED (we have Slack, Notion, async video)

Reconstruction:
Given only: need for awareness, 2-3 day cycle, and async tools exist...

Build:
- Kill the weekly meeting
- Daily 2-min async video updates (Loom)
- Automatic blocker escalation in Slack
- Bi-weekly 30-min sync for relationship-building only (no status updates)

Key Insight: The meeting's purpose (awareness) was being served badly by its mechanism (synchronous verbal). The atom "sync is required for awareness" was never true—it was just the only option in 1990.
```

**Why it's deep:**
- Atoms are genuine fundamentals, not features
- Questions were actually asked
- An atom was identified as expired
- Reconstruction is genuinely different
- Clear insight emerged

---

## Finding True Atoms

### How Deep is Deep Enough?

You've found a true atom when:
1. **It's unfactorizable:** You can't break it down further without losing meaning
2. **It's domain-independent:** It would be true outside your specific context
3. **You can cite evidence:** There's support beyond "we believe this"

### Examples of True Atoms

**Physics:** Energy is conserved. You can't exceed the speed of light. Entropy increases.

**Human nature:** People prefer less effort to more. Attention is scarce. Incentives shape behavior.

**Logic:** If A implies B, and B is false, then A is false.

**Economics:** Scarcity requires allocation. Value is subjective. Trade-offs exist.

### Examples of False Atoms (Actually Compound)

**"You need a car to commute"**
- Actually: You need to travel. Car is one option. (False atom: "car" could be bike, bus, remote work)

**"You need a degree to get hired"**
- Actually: You need to signal competence. Degree is one signal. (False atom: degree could be portfolio, referral, trial project)

**"You need an office for collaboration"**
- Actually: You need synchronous communication. Office is one enabler. (False atom: office could be video, shared workspace time)

## Quality Criteria

Your first principles analysis is **strong** if:

- [ ] Atoms are genuine fundamentals, not features of the current approach
- [ ] At least one atom was marked Expired or Never True
- [ ] Reconstruction looks meaningfully different from original
- [ ] The user has a clear insight they didn't have before
- [ ] You could explain the reconstruction to someone unfamiliar with the original

Your first principles analysis is **weak** if:

- [ ] "Decomposition" is just listing aspects of the current approach
- [ ] All atoms validated (you weren't questioning hard enough)
- [ ] Reconstruction is tweaking the original
- [ ] No genuine insight emerged
- [ ] You needed to reference the original to explain the reconstruction

---

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Confusing Components with Atoms
**Symptom:** "Decomposition" lists parts of the thing, not underlying beliefs
**Fix:** Keep asking "why" until you reach claims about reality, not descriptions of the thing

### 2. Not Actually Questioning
**Symptom:** Every atom is "Valid" with brief justification
**Fix:** Genuinely try to invalidate each atom. What would make it false?

### 3. Reconstruction Looks Like Renovation
**Symptom:** New approach is "same but better"
**Fix:** Don't look at the original during reconstruction. Let atoms lead.

### 4. Stopping at Convention
**Symptom:** "That's just how it's done" accepted as an atom
**Fix:** "How it's done" is never an atom. Ask WHY it's done that way.

### 5. Missing Expired Atoms
**Symptom:** No consideration of what used to be true but isn't anymore
**Fix:** For each atom, ask: "Was there a time when this wasn't true? Has something changed?"

---

## The Courage Required

First principles analysis often leads to uncomfortable conclusions:

- "We shouldn't be in this business"
- "This role shouldn't exist"
- "Our competitive advantage is gone"
- "We've been doing this wrong for years"

**Your job (Claude):** Go where the analysis leads, even if it's uncomfortable. The user asked for first principles—they want the truth, not validation.

**Possible user reactions:**
- **Resistance:** "But we can't just change everything"
- Your response: Acknowledge the cost of change, but present the truth
- **Denial:** "Those atoms aren't really expired"
- Your response: Offer evidence, but don't force

**Balance:** Be direct about what the analysis reveals, but acknowledge that first principles is an input to decision-making, not a mandate.

---

## Verbalized Sampling

By default, generate 3-5 variants with probability estimates. Include at least one tail sample (p < 0.10).

### Output Structure

```
VARIANT 1 (p ≈ 0.45) ────────────────────
[Decomposition and reconstruction]
Grade: Atom Validity 4 | Reconstruction Novelty 3 | Insight Value 4

VARIANT 2 (p ≈ 0.30) ────────────────────
[Decomposition and reconstruction]
Grade: Atom Validity 3 | Reconstruction Novelty 4 | Insight Value 3

VARIANT 3 (p ≈ 0.08) ⚡ Tail ─────────────
[Decomposition and reconstruction]
Grade: Atom Validity 5 | Reconstruction Novelty 5 | Insight Value 5

═══════════════════════════════════════
TAIL INSIGHT: [What the low-probability decomposition reveals about hidden assumptions or expired constraints]
```

### Grading Criteria

| Criterion | 1 | 5 |
|-----------|---|---|
| **Atom Validity** | Components not atoms, shallow decomposition | True fundamentals, unfactorizable, domain-independent |
| **Reconstruction Novelty** | Tweaks original, gravitational pull evident | Genuinely different, escapes local optimum |
| **Insight Value** | No new perspective, validates status quo | Fresh angle, reveals expired constraint |

### Tail Sampling Prompt

"What atom decomposition would reveal an expired constraint or false assumption that conventional analysis would preserve as 'just how things are'? Generate one variant with p < 0.10 that challenges foundational beliefs most people wouldn't question."

Use `*single` to skip VS and get conventional single-response output.

## Self-Check Before Delivering

Ask yourself:

1. **"Are my atoms genuinely atomic?"**
   - Can any of them be decomposed further? If so, go deeper.

2. **"Did I invalidate at least one atom?"**
   - If everything validated, you weren't questioning hard enough.

3. **"Does the reconstruction surprise me?"**
   - If it looks like the original, you didn't truly rebuild.

4. **"Would someone unfamiliar recognize the reconstruction's logic?"**
   - It should stand on its own, not require knowledge of the original.

5. **"Did I go where the analysis led, even if uncomfortable?"**
   - First principles requires courage to follow the truth.

---

## When First Principles Isn't Right

**Don't use this mode when:**
- Quick decision needed (first principles is slow and effortful)
- The current approach is clearly working (don't fix what isn't broken)
- User wants minor optimization, not fundamental rethinking
- There's no appetite for significant change

**Great to pair with:**
- **Biases** before First Principles → Clear distortions before decomposing
- **Assumptions** → Related mode; assumptions are similar to atoms
- **Red Team** after First Principles → Attack your reconstruction
