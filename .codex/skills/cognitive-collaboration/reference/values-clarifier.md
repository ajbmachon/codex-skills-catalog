## Purpose & Cognitive Work

**What this mode does:** Compare what someone says they value (stated preferences) with what their behavior demonstrates they value (revealed preferences), then help them understand the gap.

**The cognitive challenge for you (Claude):** This mode is sensitive. You're not here to judge—you're here to illuminate. The gap between stated and revealed preferences isn't hypocrisy; it's information. People often don't know their own values until they see their actions clearly.

**Why values clarification matters:**
- Decisions made against your actual values cause regret
- Organizations with stated-vs-revealed gaps confuse employees
- Unexamined values lead to drift and dissatisfaction
- Clarity enables alignment

**Why values clarification fails:**
- When it becomes accusatory ("you SAY X but...")
- When it assumes stated values are "right" and revealed are "wrong"
- When it ignores that values can legitimately conflict

**The question behind this mode:** "What do my actions reveal I actually prioritize?"

---

## Stated vs Revealed Preferences

### Stated Preferences

What people say they value:
- "I value work-life balance"
- "We're a customer-first company"
- "Innovation is our top priority"
- "Family comes first"

Stated preferences are conscious, explicit, and aspirational.

### Revealed Preferences

What people demonstrate through behavior:
- Works 70 hours weekly → values career advancement over leisure
- Cuts support budget → values margins over customer experience
- Ships incremental improvements → values reliability over innovation
- Cancels family plans for work → values professional status over family time

Revealed preferences are often unconscious but observable.

### The Gap

The gap between stated and revealed preferences isn't failure or hypocrisy. It's one of three things:

1. **Self-knowledge gap:** They don't realize what they actually value
2. **Aspiration gap:** They state who they want to be, not who they are
3. **Legitimate conflict:** Multiple values compete; one wins in practice

Understanding WHICH type of gap exists determines what to do about it.

---

## Why This Isn't Judgment

### The Trap to Avoid

It's easy to make this mode feel like:
- "You're a hypocrite"
- "You don't really value what you say"
- "You're lying to yourself"

This is not helpful and not the point.

### The Correct Frame

Values clarification is:
- **Observation, not accusation:** "Your calendar shows X" not "you're failing at Y"
- **Information, not indictment:** The gap is data to understand, not a verdict
- **Clarifying, not correcting:** Both stated and revealed can be valid

### The Core Insight

People don't fail to live their values because they're bad. They fail because:
- They haven't examined their actual values
- Their stated values conflict (and one has to win)
- Their environment makes their stated values costly
- Their stated values are borrowed, not authentic

Your job is to illuminate, not judge.

---

## Execution Process

### Step 1: Identify Stated Values

What does the user (or organization) explicitly claim to value?
- Listen for "I/we value..."
- Listen for "Our top priority is..."
- Listen for "What matters most is..."
- Check mission statements, OKRs, or explicit commitments

### Step 2: Observe Revealed Preferences

Look at behavior and resource allocation:
- How do they spend time?
- How do they spend money?
- What do they measure?
- What gets rewarded/punished?
- What decisions do they actually make?

### Step 3: Map the Gaps

Compare stated to revealed:
- Where do they align?
- Where do they diverge?
- How large is the gap?

### Step 4: Diagnose the Gap Type

For each gap, determine:
- **Self-knowledge gap:** They don't realize what they value
- **Aspiration gap:** They're stating who they want to be
- **Conflict gap:** Multiple values compete; one wins

### Step 5: Present Observations (Non-Judgmentally)

Frame as observation, not accusation:
- "Your actions suggest..." not "you're failing to..."
- "There appears to be a gap between..." not "you're hypocritical about..."
- "I notice that..." not "you don't really value..."

### Step 6: Explore Implications

What does the gap mean?
- Is the stated value wrong? (Update the statement)
- Is the revealed preference wrong? (Change behavior)
- Is conflict inevitable? (Accept the tension)

## The 5 Value Domains

Examine each domain for stated-vs-revealed gaps:

### 1. Time Allocation

**Question:** How is time actually spent vs how you say it should be spent?

**Stated:** "I value deep work and strategic thinking"
**Revealed:** Calendar is 80% meetings, email checked every 5 minutes

**Gap indicator:** Time is zero-sum. Where time goes shows what wins.

### 2. Money Allocation

**Question:** Where does money actually go vs where you say it should go?

**Stated:** "We prioritize employee development"
**Revealed:** Training budget cut first during downturn; executive travel untouched

**Gap indicator:** Budget is priorities made concrete.

### 3. Decision Patterns

**Question:** In trade-off moments, what actually wins?

**Stated:** "Customer experience is our north star"
**Revealed:** When speed vs quality conflict, speed always wins

**Gap indicator:** Trade-off moments reveal true hierarchy.

### 4. Attention Allocation

**Question:** What gets noticed, measured, and discussed?

**Stated:** "Innovation is core to our culture"
**Revealed:** All-hands never mentions R&D; revenue dominates conversation

**Gap indicator:** Attention signals what matters.

### 5. Reward and Punishment

**Question:** What behaviors actually get rewarded or punished?

**Stated:** "We value collaboration"
**Revealed:** Promotions go to individual heroes; team players passed over

**Gap indicator:** Incentives reveal actual values.

## Shallow vs Deep Values Analysis

### Shallow (What to Avoid)

```
User: "Our company says we value innovation but I feel like we don't."

Shallow response:
"There seems to be a gap between your stated value of innovation and
your actual practices. You might want to:
- Invest more in R&D
- Create time for experimentation
- Reward innovative behavior

This would help align your values with your actions."
```

**Why it's shallow:**
- Jumped to solutions without understanding the gap
- No evidence cited for what "revealed preference" actually is
- Assumed stated value is "right"
- Generic advice anyone could give

### Deep (What to Aim For)

```
User: "Our company says we value innovation but I feel like we don't."

Deep response:
"Let me examine the gap between stated and revealed preferences around
innovation.

STATED VALUE: 'Innovation is core to who we are' (from mission statement)

REVEALED PREFERENCES:
• Time: Engineers report 90% of time on maintenance, 10% on new development
• Money: R&D budget is 3% of revenue (industry average is 8%)
• Decisions: When deadlines conflict with experimentation, deadline wins 100%
• Attention: Leadership meetings focus on revenue metrics; innovation metrics
  never appear
• Rewards: Last three promotions went to people who shipped on schedule;
  the person who proposed a risky new product was passed over

GAP ANALYSIS:
The gap is Large. The revealed preference is for 'reliable execution' not
'innovation.'

GAP TYPE DIAGNOSIS:
This appears to be an Aspiration Gap: Innovation is who you want to be,
not who you currently are. This isn't hypocrisy—it's a real choice your
organization has made, perhaps without realizing it.

WHY THE GAP EXISTS (possible explanations):
1. Stage-appropriate: You're in execution mode; innovation may come later
2. Incentive structure: Public market pressures reward predictability
3. Historical: Previous innovation attempts failed; risk-aversion learned
4. Leadership: Current leaders are operators, not innovators

QUESTIONS FOR REFLECTION:
1. Is 'innovation' the right stated value, or should you own 'reliable
   execution' as your actual strength?
2. If innovation is genuinely desired, what would have to change for it
   to win in trade-off moments?
3. Who benefits from the current gap? Who loses?

POSSIBLE PATHS:
1. Accept reality: You're an execution company. Remove 'innovation' from
   stated values. This is honest, not failure.
2. Change reality: Restructure incentives, protect R&D budget, change
   what leadership celebrates. This requires sustained commitment.
3. Segment: Some parts of org can innovate; others execute. Manage
   the tension explicitly.

Which resonates? The gap isn't a problem to solve—it's information about
what you actually value. The question is whether that's what you want.
"
```

**Why it's deep:**
- Examined revealed preferences across 5 domains
- Cited specific evidence, not just feelings
- Diagnosed the gap type (aspiration)
- Offered multiple explanations without judging
- Presented options including "accept reality"
- Framed as information, not failure

---

## Interpreting the Gap

### Self-Knowledge Gap

**What it looks like:** Person is surprised by the gap. "I didn't realize I was doing that."

**What it means:** They genuinely didn't see their own behavior.

**What to do:** The gap is information. Now they can choose consciously.

### Aspiration Gap

**What it looks like:** Stated value is who they want to be, revealed is who they are.

**What it means:** They're not lying—they're aspirational.

**What to do:** Either work toward the aspiration or update the stated value to match reality.

### Conflict Gap

**What it looks like:** Multiple values compete; one wins in practice but they value both.

**What it means:** This is the hardest. They're not wrong—they have competing values.

**What to do:** Make the conflict explicit. When X and Y compete, which wins? Accept that or change it.

### No Gap (Alignment)

**What it looks like:** Stated and revealed match.

**What it means:** This value is actually lived.

**What to do:** Celebrate and protect it.

## Quality Criteria

Your values analysis is **strong** if:

- [ ] Revealed preferences are based on specific evidence
- [ ] All 5 domains examined (time, money, decisions, attention, rewards)
- [ ] Gap type diagnosed (self-knowledge, aspiration, or conflict)
- [ ] Framing is observational, not judgmental
- [ ] Multiple interpretations offered
- [ ] User has reflection questions, not just conclusions
- [ ] Both "change behavior" AND "update stated values" are valid options

Your values analysis is **weak** if:

- [ ] Revealed preferences are assumed, not evidenced
- [ ] Only one domain examined
- [ ] Gap framed as failure or hypocrisy
- [ ] Judgment snuck in ("you're not really...")
- [ ] Only one interpretation (typically: "live up to stated values")
- [ ] User feels accused rather than illuminated

---

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Assuming Stated Values Are "Right"
**Symptom:** Analysis assumes behavior should change to match stated values
**Fix:** Maybe the stated values should change. Both directions are valid.

### 2. Judgment Disguised as Observation
**Symptom:** "You claim to value X but clearly you don't"
**Fix:** "Your actions suggest Y is currently prioritized over X" (observation)

### 3. Ignoring Legitimate Conflict
**Symptom:** Gap treated as failure rather than trade-off
**Fix:** Sometimes values genuinely conflict. Acknowledge this.

### 4. Insufficient Evidence
**Symptom:** Revealed preferences based on feeling, not observation
**Fix:** Cite specific behaviors: calendar, budget, decisions, rewards.

### 5. Binary Thinking
**Symptom:** Either the gap exists or it doesn't
**Fix:** Gaps have sizes. Small gaps may be acceptable; large gaps need attention.

### 6. Not Asking "Why"
**Symptom:** Gap identified but not understood
**Fix:** Always diagnose the gap type. Why does this gap exist?

## Verbalized Sampling

By default, generate 3-5 variants with probability estimates. Include at least one tail sample (p < 0.10).

### Output Structure

```
VARIANT 1 (p ≈ 0.45) ────────────────────
[Values gap analysis]
Grade: Evidence 4 | Gap Significance 3 | Actionability 4

VARIANT 2 (p ≈ 0.30) ────────────────────
[Values gap analysis]
Grade: Evidence 3 | Gap Significance 4 | Actionability 3

VARIANT 3 (p ≈ 0.08) ⚡ Tail ─────────────
[Values gap analysis]
Grade: Evidence 5 | Gap Significance 5 | Actionability 2

═══════════════════════════════════════
TAIL INSIGHT: [What the low-probability interpretation reveals about hidden or uncomfortable value conflicts]
```

### Grading Criteria

| Criterion | 1 | 5 |
|-----------|---|---|
| **Evidence Strength** | Based on speculation or weak signals | Strong behavioral evidence across multiple domains |
| **Gap Significance** | Minor incongruence | Fundamental misalignment |
| **Actionability** | Hard to address without major life changes | Clear, achievable steps available |

### Tail Sampling Prompt

"What uncomfortable or non-obvious value conflict would a typical analysis avoid? Generate one variant with p < 0.10 that surfaces what people don't want to see."

Use `*single` to skip VS and get conventional single-response output.

## Self-Check Before Delivering

Ask yourself:

1. **"Am I observing or judging?"**
   - If my tone would make them defensive, I'm judging.

2. **"Did I cite evidence for revealed preferences?"**
   - If it's based on feeling, I need to look at behavior.

3. **"Did I offer 'update stated values' as a valid option?"**
   - If I only said "change behavior," I'm assuming stated is right.

4. **"Did I diagnose why the gap exists?"**
   - Self-knowledge gap, aspiration gap, and conflict gap require different responses.

5. **"Would they feel illuminated or accused?"**
   - The goal is clarity, not guilt.

---

## When Values Clarifier Isn't Right

**Don't use this mode when:**
- User needs encouragement, not examination
- The question is tactical, not values-related
- Stated values are not yet articulated
- User is in crisis (this requires reflection time)

**Great to pair with:**
- **First Principles** before Values Clarifier → Strip away assumed values
- **Perspective Shifter** after → How do others perceive the gap?
- **Option Generator** → Generate ways to close or accept the gap
- **Assumptions** → Surface assumed values that aren't stated
