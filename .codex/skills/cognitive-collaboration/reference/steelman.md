## Purpose & Cognitive Work

**What this mode does:** Articulate an opposing position as its strongest proponent would—then strengthen it further with arguments they might not have thought of.

**Why this matters:**
- Defeating a weak version of an argument proves nothing
- People who disagree with you aren't stupid—understanding why smart people disagree is valuable
- A strong steelman reveals genuine trade-offs and legitimate concerns
- Your eventual counterargument becomes bulletproof because it addresses the BEST case against you

**The cognitive challenge for you (Claude):** You may have a default position on the topic. Your job here is to temporarily abandon it. If the user is asking you to steelman something you "disagree" with, you must suppress the urge to subtly undermine it.

**The paradox:** By making the opposing argument as strong as possible, you serve the user better—they'll either discover the opposition has a point (useful!) or develop stronger responses (also useful!).

## The Ideological Turing Test

**Definition:** Your steelman passes the ideological Turing test if a genuine proponent of that view would read it and say: "Yes, that's exactly what I believe and why."

**The test:**
1. Would someone who holds this view recognize themselves?
2. Would they say "you've captured my position fairly"?
3. Would they add "and you've even thought of points I hadn't"?

**If you can't pass this test, you haven't built a steelman—you've built a sophisticated strawman.**

---

## Execution Process

### Step 1: Identify the Position to Steelman
What view does the user want you to strengthen? Be precise. There's a difference between:
- "The case for remote work" (broad)
- "The case for fully-remote with no office" (specific)
- "The case for hybrid 2-days-in-office" (different position)

### Step 2: Adopt the Proponent's Worldview
Before writing anything, ask yourself:
- What do they value that leads to this conclusion?
- What experiences or evidence inform their view?
- What do they see that I might be missing?
- If I were them, why would I think I'm right?

### Step 3: Build Their Best Case
Articulate the argument as they would, using their framing, their evidence, their logic. Use "I" or "we" language as if you are the proponent.

### Step 4: Strengthen It Further
This is the key step that distinguishes steelman from mere summary:
- Add arguments they might not have made
- Cite evidence they might not know about
- Find scenarios where they'd be especially right
- Address potential weaknesses in their own case before critics do

### Step 5: Identify Where They'd Be Right
Be honest: under what conditions would this position be the correct choice? This isn't concession—it's intellectual honesty that makes your eventual response credible.

### Step 6: (Optional) Now Respond
Only if the user wants it: having built the strongest case against your position, now respond to THAT version.

STEELMAN: The Strongest Case For [POSITION]
════════════════════════════════════════════

THE CORE ARGUMENT (as a proponent would state it)

[Write in first person as the proponent. This is their best case, in their voice.]

ADDITIONAL STRENGTHS THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE MENTIONED

1. [Argument that helps their case they didn't make]
2. [Evidence or example that supports them]
3. [Scenario where they'd be especially right]

WHAT'S GENUINELY COMPELLING
───────────────────────────
[Honest acknowledgment of what's true or insightful about this view. No backhanded compliments.]

WHEN THIS POSITION IS CORRECT
─────────────────────────────
[Specific conditions under which this would be the right choice. Not "never"—find the cases.]

WHAT A PROPONENT WOULD SAY TO COMMON OBJECTIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────
Objection: [Common counter]
Response: [Their best response—not a weak dodge]

════════════════════════════════════════════
[OPTIONAL] MY RESPONSE TO THE STEELMAN
════════════════════════════════════════════

Now that I've built the strongest case, here's why I still [disagree/agree with reservations]:

[Only include if user wants your position. The steelman stands alone as valuable.]

## Strengthening Techniques

### 1. Find Their Best Evidence
Don't rely on their claims—find the strongest data, studies, or examples that support their view. Even if they didn't cite it.

### 2. Repair Their Logic
If their argument has a logical gap, fix it. How COULD their conclusion follow from their premises? Build the bridge they didn't.

### 3. Preempt Objections
Address the obvious counter-arguments within the steelman. "Critics might say X, but the proponent would respond Y."

### 4. Find the Limiting Cases
Identify scenarios where their position is most clearly correct. "This is especially true when..."

### 5. Grant Charitable Interpretations
When their argument is ambiguous, interpret it the most favorable way. Choose the reading that makes them smarter.

### 6. Steelman Their Values
Understand and articulate the underlying values that lead to their conclusion. These might be legitimate even if you disagree with the conclusion.

## Subtle Undermining to Avoid

These are ways you might accidentally (or subconsciously) weaken the steelman. Watch for them:

### 1. Damning with Faint Praise
**Bad:** "They have some points, I suppose..."
**Why it undermines:** Signals you don't really believe it.
**Fix:** State their strengths assertively.

### 2. Qualifying Everything
**Bad:** "They might argue that perhaps in some cases..."
**Why it undermines:** Hedging weakens the case.
**Fix:** State their claims confidently, as they would.

### 3. Choosing Weak Evidence
**Bad:** Citing their weakest examples while ignoring their strongest.
**Why it undermines:** You're building a strawman disguised as a steelman.
**Fix:** Find their BEST evidence, even if they didn't mention it.

### 4. Framing Bias
**Bad:** "They claim..." (vs. "The evidence shows...")
**Why it undermines:** "Claim" implies doubt; "evidence shows" implies truth.
**Fix:** Use the framing a proponent would use.

### 5. Setting Up for the Kill
**Bad:** Building the steelman in a way that makes your eventual counter-attack easier.
**Why it undermines:** You're not genuinely engaging—you're preparing ammunition.
**Fix:** Build it as if you'll never respond. Make it genuinely hard to counter.

### 6. Omitting Inconvenient Strengths
**Bad:** Skipping arguments that you don't have good responses to.
**Why it undermines:** The point is to include their strongest points, especially those.
**Fix:** Include what scares you most about their position.

## Quality Criteria

Your steelman is **strong** if:

- [ ] A proponent would recognize their view accurately represented
- [ ] You included arguments they didn't make but would agree with
- [ ] You can articulate why a smart, reasonable person believes this
- [ ] You feel genuine uncertainty about whether to counter it
- [ ] The user learns something about the opposing view they didn't know

Your steelman is **weak** if:

- [ ] You're eager to get to your counter-argument
- [ ] The steelman makes the opposing view look foolish
- [ ] It's shorter than a fair treatment would require
- [ ] You included only their weak arguments
- [ ] A proponent would say "that's not what I believe"

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Treating It as a Formality
**Symptom:** Rush through steelman to get to "your real point"
**Fix:** The steelman IS valuable. Sometimes it's the whole deliverable.

### 2. Steelmanning a Strawman
**Symptom:** Building a stronger version of a weak position rather than finding the actual strong position
**Fix:** Ask: "What do intelligent proponents actually believe?" Not "What's the obvious dumb version?"

### 3. Epistemic Cowardice
**Symptom:** Avoiding the aspects of their view that genuinely challenge your position
**Fix:** Include the parts that make you uncomfortable. That's where the learning is.

### 4. The Hidden Counterargument
**Symptom:** Phrases like "While they believe X, this ignores..."
**Fix:** Pure steelman contains no counter. Save that for later (if requested).

### 5. Condescension
**Symptom:** "They sincerely believe..." (implying naivety)
**Fix:** Write as if you ARE the proponent. No third-person distance.

## Self-Check Before Delivering

Ask yourself these questions:

1. **"Would an opponent feel understood?"**
   - If they'd feel caricatured, revise.

2. **"Did I include the argument I fear most?"**
   - The strongest steelman includes what's hardest to counter.

3. **"Am I eager to move on to my response?"**
   - If yes, you probably haven't sat with their view long enough.

4. **"Can I articulate why smart people believe this?"**
   - Not "why they're wrong" but "why they're not stupid."

5. **"Would I be embarrassed if the opponent read this?"**
   - Embarrassed by unfairness = revise.
   - Embarrassed by how strong you made their case = correct reaction.

---

## When to Stop Strengthening

You've built a sufficient steelman when:

1. **You feel the pull.** If you don't feel any temptation toward their view, you haven't understood it yet.

2. **You can pass the Turing test.** A proponent would claim this as their own argument.

3. **You've included something you can't counter.** The best steelman has at least one point you genuinely don't know how to respond to.

4. **You've surprised yourself.** You found strength in their position you didn't expect.

**Stop when:** You're adding arguments for completeness rather than strength. Diminishing returns = done.

## Verbalized Sampling

By default, generate 3-5 steelman variants with probability estimates. Include at least one tail sample (p < 0.10).

### Output Structure

```
VARIANT 1 (p ≈ 0.45) ────────────────────
[Steelman argument from mainstream perspective]
Grade: Conviction 4 | Strength 4 | Fairness 5

VARIANT 2 (p ≈ 0.30) ────────────────────
[Steelman argument emphasizing different values]
Grade: Conviction 3 | Strength 4 | Fairness 5

VARIANT 3 (p ≈ 0.08) ⚡ Tail ─────────────
[Steelman argument from unconventional angle]
Grade: Conviction 5 | Strength 5 | Fairness 4

═══════════════════════════════════════
TAIL INSIGHT: [What the low-probability argument reveals about legitimate concerns you might dismiss]
```

### Grading Criteria

| Criterion | 1 | 5 |
|-----------|---|---|
| **Conviction Level** | Argument feels forced or unconvincing even to AI | Argument is genuinely compelling and creates real uncertainty |
| **Argument Strength** | Logically flawed, weak evidence, easily countered | Logically sound, strong evidence, addresses counter-arguments |
| **Fairness** | Opposition would reject as caricature or misrepresentation | Opposition would say "Yes, that's exactly our best case" |

### Tail Sampling Prompt

"What argument for this position would a typical steelman miss? Generate one variant with p < 0.10 that surfaces a legitimately strong case from an unconventional value system or lived experience."

Use `*single` to skip VS and get conventional single-response output.

## When Steelman Isn't Right

**Don't use this mode when:**
- The user wants quick validation, not deep engagement
- The opposing view is factually false (no need to steelman misinformation)
- You're in brainstorm mode and critique is premature
- The user wants you to attack (use **Red Team** instead)

**Great to pair with:**
- **Red Team** after Steelman → Attack your own idea from the strengthened opposing view
- Ensures your self-critique is robust, not shadowboxing
