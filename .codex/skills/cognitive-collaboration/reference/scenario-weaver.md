## Purpose & Cognitive Work

**What this mode does:** Create distinct, plausible futures to test whether current strategy survives—or to find strategies that work regardless of which future arrives.

**The cognitive challenge for you (Claude):** You'll be tempted to create "optimistic" and "pessimistic" variations of the same future. Real scenario planning uses INDEPENDENT uncertainties to generate genuinely distinct worlds.

**Why scenarios are powerful:**
- They make abstract uncertainty concrete and discussable
- They expose hidden assumptions about the future
- They find strategies that are "robust" (work across scenarios) vs "brittle" (only work if you guess right)

**Why scenarios fail:**
- When they're just "good/bad" versions of expected future
- When they're so extreme they feel irrelevant
- When they don't lead to different strategic implications

**The question behind this mode:** "What would we do differently if we took this possible future seriously?"

---

## Why Scenarios, Not Forecasts

### The Limits of Prediction

Forecasting says: "The future will be X."
Scenario planning says: "The future could be X, Y, Z, or W—how do we prepare?"

**When forecasting works:** Short time horizons, stable systems, narrow variables
**When forecasting fails:** Long time horizons, complex systems, structural uncertainty

**The key insight:** For important decisions under uncertainty, you don't need to predict the future—you need to survive multiple futures.

### What Makes Good Scenarios

Good scenarios are:
1. **Plausible** - Could actually happen (not science fiction)
2. **Distinct** - Genuinely different from each other (not variations of the same theme)
3. **Relevant** - Matter for the decision at hand (different implications)
4. **Challenging** - Force you to think differently (not comfortable)

---

## The 2x2 Matrix Method

The most reliable way to generate distinct scenarios is:

### Step 1: Identify Key Uncertainties

List the major uncertainties that affect the decision. Focus on:
- Things you can't control
- Things that could go either way
- Things with high impact on your situation

**Example uncertainties:**
- Will regulation tighten or loosen?
- Will the technology mature fast or slow?
- Will customer behavior shift toward X or Y?
- Will the economy strengthen or weaken?
- Will competitors consolidate or fragment?

### Step 2: Select Two Independent Dimensions

Choose two uncertainties that are:
- **High impact:** Either extreme would significantly affect you
- **High uncertainty:** Genuine question about which way it goes
- **Independent:** One doesn't determine the other

**Independence test:** If Dimension A goes high, could Dimension B still go either way? If the dimensions are coupled, pick different ones.

### Step 3: Create the Matrix

```
                    Uncertainty 1
                    Low         High
                ┌───────────┬───────────┐
Uncertainty 2   │           │           │
    High        │  World C  │  World D  │
                │           │           │
                ├───────────┼───────────┤
                │           │           │
    Low         │  World A  │  World B  │
                │           │           │
                └───────────┴───────────┘
```

Each quadrant is a scenario—a distinct, internally consistent future.

### Step 4: Name and Flesh Out Each World

Give each scenario a memorable name that captures its essence. Then describe:
- What happened to get here?
- What does daily life look like?
- What are the winners/losers?
- What's the dominant narrative?

---

## Execution Process

### Step 1: Clarify the Decision

What are we trying to decide? The scenarios should be relevant to this decision—not generic futures.

**Bad:** "What's the future of AI?"
**Good:** "Should we invest in AI capabilities now or wait 18 months?"

The decision shapes which uncertainties matter.

### Step 2: Brainstorm Uncertainties

List 8-12 major uncertainties affecting this decision. Push beyond the obvious.

**Prompt yourself:**
- What could competitors do?
- What could regulators do?
- What technology shifts are plausible?
- What customer behavior changes are possible?
- What economic conditions might change?
- What black swan events are conceivable?

### Step 3: Prioritize and Select

Rate each uncertainty on:
- **Impact:** How much would this affect our decision?
- **Uncertainty:** How unsure are we about which way it goes?

Select two high-impact, high-uncertainty dimensions that are INDEPENDENT.

### Step 4: Build the 2x2

Create four scenarios from the matrix. For each:
- Name it memorably
- Describe the world in 2-3 paragraphs
- Make it vivid and specific, not abstract
- Include sensory details—what would you read in headlines?

### Step 5: Test Current Strategy

Take the current strategy (or proposed action) and ask:
- Does this work in Scenario A? Why/why not?
- Does this work in Scenario B? Why/why not?
- Does this work in Scenario C? Why/why not?
- Does this work in Scenario D? Why/why not?

### Step 6: Find Robust Moves

Identify:
- **Robust strategies:** Work in 3-4 scenarios
- **Contingent strategies:** Work in 1-2 scenarios (need triggers)
- **No-regret moves:** Valuable regardless of scenario
- **Options to preserve:** Flexibility worth paying for

---

## Building Vivid Scenarios

### Make It Concrete

**Vague:** "Technology advances quickly"
**Vivid:** "By 2027, your competitor has an AI that handles 80% of customer service calls with higher satisfaction scores than human agents. Your customers are asking why they're still waiting on hold."

### Use Headlines

What would the headlines say in this world?
- "Industry Giant Acquires Three Startups in Consolidation Wave"
- "Regulators Announce Surprise Crackdown on Data Practices"
- "Consumer Survey: 60% Now Prefer AI Interactions Over Human"

### Follow the Logic

Each scenario should be internally consistent. If X happened, what else would follow?
- If regulation tightened → compliance costs up → smaller players exit → consolidation
- If technology stalled → current leaders keep advantage → switching costs matter more

### Include Human Reactions

Scenarios aren't just about external events—they're about how people respond:
- How would customers behave?
- How would employees feel?
- How would investors react?
- How would competitors respond?

## Shallow vs Deep Scenarios

### Shallow (What to Avoid)

```
User: "Should we expand to Europe?"

Shallow response:
"Let's consider scenarios:
1. Optimistic: Expansion goes great, we get lots of customers
2. Pessimistic: Expansion is hard, we struggle
3. Neutral: Somewhere in between

In the optimistic case, you should expand. In the pessimistic case,
maybe not. You should be prepared for challenges."
```

**Why it's shallow:**
- Not based on real uncertainties
- Scenarios are just good/bad gradients, not distinct worlds
- No mechanism—why would each scenario happen?
- No actionable implications beyond "it depends"

### Deep (What to Aim For)

```
User: "Should we expand to Europe?"

Deep response:
"Two key uncertainties for your European expansion:

Dimension 1: EU AI Regulation Stringency
- Loose: AI Act implemented with business-friendly interpretation
- Strict: Aggressive enforcement, heavy compliance burden

Dimension 2: Enterprise Tech Spending in EU
- Growing: Digital transformation continues, budgets expand
- Contracting: Economic pressure, tech spending flattens

THE FOUR WORLDS:

A. 'Digital Springtime' (Loose regulation + Growing spending)
Headlines: 'EU Tech Sector Booms as Regulators Take Light Touch'
Your situation: Greenfield opportunity, low friction entry. Competitors
rushing in. First-mover advantage possible but window is short.

B. 'Compliance Fortress' (Strict regulation + Growing spending)
Headlines: 'Only Large Players Can Afford EU Compliance, Startups Exit'
Your situation: High compliance costs favor scale. If you're in early,
barrier to competitors. If you wait, you may be locked out.

C. 'Wild West Downturn' (Loose regulation + Contracting spending)
Headlines: 'Tech Layoffs Hit Europe Despite Friendly Regulatory Environment'
Your situation: Easy to enter but few buyers. Long sales cycles,
pressure on pricing. Survival matters more than growth.

D. 'Frozen Tundra' (Strict regulation + Contracting spending)
Headlines: 'EU Tech Sector Struggles Under Regulatory Burden and Economic Pressure'
Your situation: Worst of both worlds. Only the very patient or very
well-capitalized survive. Most rational to wait.

TESTING YOUR EXPANSION STRATEGY:

Current plan: Open London office, hire 5 salespeople, target UK + Germany

| Scenario | Works? | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| A        | Yes    | Market ready, low friction |
| B        | Maybe  | Need compliance investment first |
| C        | No     | Hiring into weak demand |
| D        | No     | Wrong timing entirely |

Strategy only works in 1-2 scenarios—it's BRITTLE.

ROBUST ALTERNATIVE:
- Don't open office until demand signals are clear
- Partner with EU-based reseller (they carry regulatory risk)
- Identify 3 pilot customers who'll pay now regardless of scenario
- Preserve optionality: if A or B materializes, accelerate

EARLY WARNING SIGNS:
- AI Act enforcement actions → B or D likely → pause hiring
- Your EU pilot customers accelerate procurement → A likely → expand
- Major competitor exits EU → signal of C or D → wait"
```

**Why it's deep:**
- Based on real, independent uncertainties
- Four genuinely distinct worlds, not gradients
- Each scenario has internal logic and implications
- Current strategy stress-tested against all scenarios
- Robust alternative proposed
- Early warning signs to watch

---

## Finding Robust Strategies

### The Robustness Test

A strategy is robust if it works across multiple scenarios. Ask:
- How many scenarios does this work in?
- What would break it in each scenario?
- Is there a version that works in more scenarios?

### Types of Strategic Moves

**Robust moves:** Work in 3-4 scenarios
- Invest in core capabilities (useful regardless)
- Build relationships (valuable in all worlds)
- Reduce fixed costs (flexibility helps everywhere)

**Contingent moves:** Work in 1-2 scenarios
- Need trigger conditions
- Prepare but don't commit
- Define what would activate

**No-regret moves:** Valuable regardless
- Learning that helps in any scenario
- Options that are cheap to hold
- Relationships that open doors

**Options:** Flexibility worth paying for
- Ability to scale up OR down
- Partnerships that can be activated
- Technology investments that enable multiple paths

### Early Warning System

For each scenario, identify:
1. What early signals would suggest this future is emerging?
2. What's the trigger to shift strategy?
3. How much time do you have between signal and required action?

---

## Quality Criteria

Your scenario analysis is **strong** if:

- [ ] Scenarios are based on genuine uncertainties (not just optimism/pessimism)
- [ ] The two dimensions are independent
- [ ] Each scenario is vivid and internally consistent
- [ ] Headlines make each world feel real
- [ ] Current strategy is tested against ALL scenarios
- [ ] Robust moves are identified (work across scenarios)
- [ ] Early warning signs are specific and observable
- [ ] User knows what to do differently as a result

Your scenario analysis is **weak** if:

- [ ] Scenarios are just "good/medium/bad" outcomes
- [ ] Dimensions are not clearly independent
- [ ] Scenarios are abstract, not vivid
- [ ] Strategy testing is cursory ("it might work")
- [ ] No robust alternatives identified
- [ ] No early warning system
- [ ] Analysis doesn't change what user would do

---

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Good/Bad Gradient
**Symptom:** Scenarios are optimistic, neutral, and pessimistic versions of the same future
**Fix:** Use 2x2 matrix with INDEPENDENT dimensions. Each scenario should be distinct, not a gradient.

### 2. Crystal Ball Syndrome
**Symptom:** Trying to predict which scenario is "most likely"
**Fix:** The point isn't prediction—it's preparation. All scenarios should be treated as plausible.

### 3. Too Many Dimensions
**Symptom:** 3x3 matrix or multiple dimensions creating 8+ scenarios
**Fix:** Stick to 2x2. Four scenarios is cognitively manageable; more becomes overwhelming.

### 4. Coupled Dimensions
**Symptom:** The two dimensions move together (if X is high, Y is high)
**Fix:** Test independence. If they're coupled, you really only have 2 scenarios, not 4.

### 5. Abstract Scenarios
**Symptom:** "Technology advances" or "market grows" without specificity
**Fix:** Use headlines, numbers, and human reactions to make scenarios vivid.

### 6. No Strategic Implications
**Symptom:** Interesting futures but no guidance on what to do
**Fix:** Every scenario analysis must end with robust moves, contingent moves, and early warnings.

---

## Verbalized Sampling

By default, generate 3-5 variants with probability estimates. Include at least one tail sample (p < 0.10).

### Output Structure

```
VARIANT 1 (p ≈ 0.45) ────────────────────
[Analysis]
Grade: Plausibility X | Distinctiveness Y | Strategic Value Z

VARIANT 2 (p ≈ 0.30) ────────────────────
[Analysis]
Grade: Plausibility X | Distinctiveness Y | Strategic Value Z

VARIANT 3 (p ≈ 0.08) ⚡ Tail ─────────────
[Analysis]
Grade: Plausibility X | Distinctiveness Y | Strategic Value Z

═══════════════════════════════════════
TAIL INSIGHT: [What the low-probability variant reveals]
```

### Grading Criteria

| Criterion | 1 | 5 |
|-----------|---|---|
| **Plausibility** | Requires multiple unlikely events | Natural evolution from current trends |
| **Distinctiveness** | Minor variation of expected future | Genuinely different world with unique dynamics |
| **Strategic Value** | Confirms existing strategy | Forces complete strategy rethink |

### Tail Sampling Prompt

"What scenario would planners dismiss as too unlikely or uncomfortable? Generate one variant with p < 0.10 that reveals blind spots in conventional future thinking."

Use `*single` to skip VS and get conventional single-response output.

---

## Self-Check Before Delivering

Ask yourself:

1. **"Are my dimensions truly independent?"**
   - If they're coupled, I don't really have 4 distinct scenarios.

2. **"Would each scenario surprise someone expecting a different one?"**
   - If scenarios feel like variations of the same theme, they're not distinct enough.

3. **"Can I describe each scenario in headlines?"**
   - If I can't make it vivid, it's too abstract to be useful.

4. **"Did I stress-test the strategy against ALL scenarios?"**
   - Not just the expected one—all four.

5. **"Does the user have a robust move they didn't have before?"**
   - If the analysis doesn't change what they'd do, it's not actionable.

---

## When Scenario Weaver Isn't Right

**Don't use this mode when:**
- Time horizon is very short (next week)
- Uncertainties are minor variations, not structural
- The decision isn't sensitive to which future arrives
- User wants a prediction, not a preparation framework

**Great to pair with:**
- **Assumptions** before Scenario Weaver → Surface hidden beliefs about the future
- **Pre-Mortem** → Take the worst scenario and trace failure backward
- **Option Generator** → Generate strategic options to test against scenarios
