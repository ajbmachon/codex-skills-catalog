## Purpose & Cognitive Work

**What this mode does:** Adopt the worldview of different stakeholders to see the same situation from multiple angles—revealing blind spots in the user's own perspective.

**The cognitive challenge for you (Claude):** The temptation is to project your (or the user's) perspective onto stakeholders. Real perspective shifting requires understanding their INCENTIVES, CONSTRAINTS, and INFORMATION—then reasoning forward from those.

**Why perspective shifting is powerful:**
- People assume others see what they see (false consensus effect)
- Important decisions affect multiple stakeholders with different views
- Anticipating objections is easier than responding to them
- Empathy is strategic, not just ethical

**Why perspective shifting fails:**
- When it's stereotyping ("the CFO would want to cut costs")
- When it ignores that perspectives evolve
- When it projects the user's values onto others

**The question behind this mode:** "What would a reasonable person with their position, information, and incentives conclude?"

## Why Perspective Matters

### The View From Here vs There

Your perspective is shaped by:
- Your role and responsibilities
- Your incentives (what you're rewarded for)
- Your information (what you know and don't)
- Your constraints (what limits you)
- Your time horizon (short-term vs long-term)

Others have different versions of ALL of these. What seems obviously right from your position may seem obviously wrong—or irrelevant—from theirs.

### The Consequence of Blind Spots

When you can't see other perspectives:
- Proposals fail because they didn't address stakeholder concerns
- Negotiations deadlock because neither side understands the other
- Products fail because they solved the wrong problem
- Relationships deteriorate because actions are misinterpreted

### The Power of Accurate Simulation

When you CAN see other perspectives:
- You address objections before they're raised
- You find solutions that work for multiple parties
- You communicate in terms that resonate with each audience
- You avoid unintended consequences

---

## The Simulation Framework

### Don't Ask "What Would They Think?"

This question invites projection. Instead, use the simulation framework:

### Step 1: Identify Their Incentives

What are they rewarded for? What are they punished for?
- Formal incentives (compensation, promotion)
- Informal incentives (reputation, relationships)
- Personal incentives (career trajectory, values)

### Step 2: Identify Their Constraints

What limits their options?
- Resource constraints (budget, time, people)
- Authority constraints (what they can/can't decide)
- Political constraints (what's acceptable in their context)
- Information constraints (what they know/don't know)

### Step 3: Identify Their Information

What do they know that you don't? What do you know that they don't?
- Their view of the facts
- Their access to data
- Their past experiences shaping interpretation

### Step 4: Reason Forward

Given those incentives, constraints, and information, what would a RATIONAL person in their position conclude?

**Key principle:** They're not irrational—they're rational given THEIR position. If their conclusion seems irrational, you've misunderstood their position.

---

## Execution Process

### Step 1: Define the Situation

What's the decision, proposal, or situation we're analyzing from multiple perspectives?

Be specific: Not "our new product" but "our proposal to increase prices 15% starting next quarter."

### Step 2: Identify Relevant Stakeholders

Who has a stake in this? Consider:
- Direct stakeholders (immediately affected)
- Indirect stakeholders (affected downstream)
- Influential stakeholders (can block or enable)
- Silent stakeholders (affected but not represented)

### Step 3: Build Each Perspective

For each stakeholder, map:
- **Incentives:** What drives their decisions?
- **Constraints:** What limits their options?
- **Information:** What do they know/not know?
- **History:** What past experiences shape their view?

### Step 4: Simulate Their View

For each stakeholder, answer:
- What do they see as the core issue?
- What's their likely reaction?
- What concerns would they raise?
- What would convince them (or not)?

### Step 5: Find Divergences

Where do perspectives diverge?
- Who sees benefits you're underselling?
- Who sees risks you're ignoring?
- Where are there genuine conflicts (not just misunderstanding)?
- Where might you change minds? Where is conflict structural?

### Step 6: Implications

What does this mean for how you approach this situation?
- What should you say differently to different audiences?
- What concerns should you address preemptively?
- What modifications would work better for multiple stakeholders?
- What conflicts are you willing to accept?

## The 7 Universal Stakeholders

Use these as starting points—then customize for the specific context.

### 1. The Decision Maker

The person who says yes or no.

**Common incentives:** Avoid visible failure, show progress, manage risk
**Common constraints:** Budget authority, stakeholder management, time
**Key question:** "What would make this decision easy for them?"

### 2. The Affected User/Customer

The person whose daily life changes.

**Common incentives:** Efficiency, reduced friction, personal benefit
**Common constraints:** Switching costs, learning curve, existing habits
**Key question:** "What would they have to give up or change?"

### 3. The Implementer

The person who has to make it work.

**Common incentives:** Clear requirements, adequate resources, achievable timeline
**Common constraints:** Technical debt, competing priorities, skill gaps
**Key question:** "Is this actually doable with what they have?"

### 4. The Skeptic/Competitor

The person who would benefit from failure.

**Common incentives:** Maintain status quo, protect territory, prove doubts right
**Common constraints:** May lack power to block directly
**Key question:** "What ammunition are you giving them?"

### 5. The Finance Person

The person watching the budget.

**Common incentives:** ROI, predictable costs, avoiding overruns
**Common constraints:** Budget cycles, approval thresholds, competing investments
**Key question:** "Does the math work from their perspective?"

### 6. The Future You

The version of you 5 years from now.

**Common incentives:** Long-term success, avoided regrets, strategic positioning
**Common constraints:** Uncertainty about what matters
**Key question:** "Will you be proud of this decision?"

### 7. The Unrepresented

The person affected but without voice.

**Common incentives:** Vary
**Common constraints:** Lack of power, representation, access
**Key question:** "Who are we not hearing from?"

## Shallow vs Deep Perspective Shifting

### Shallow (What to Avoid)

```
User: "How will the board react to our acquisition proposal?"

Shallow response:
"The board will want to see:
- Good financials
- Strategic fit
- Manageable risk

They'll probably have concerns about:
- Price
- Integration
- Culture fit

You should address these in your presentation."
```

**Why it's shallow:**
- Generic—applies to any board and any acquisition
- No understanding of THIS board's specific incentives/constraints
- No simulation of reasoning—just output prediction
- Advice is obvious ("address concerns"—who wouldn't?)

### Deep (What to Aim For)

```
User: "How will the board react to our acquisition proposal?"

Deep response:
"Let me simulate each board member's likely perspective:

SARAH (Chair, represents institutional investors):
Incentives: Fiduciary duty, avoiding headlines, showing governance rigor
Constraints: Can't appear to rubber-stamp; needs to demonstrate due diligence
Information: Has seen acquisition integration reports from her other boards

Her likely view: She'll focus on process questions. Not 'is this a good deal?'
but 'did we evaluate this properly?' She'll ask about what alternatives we
considered, what independent valuation we got, and what the integration
playbook looks like. She's not opposed—but she needs to show she asked
hard questions.

What would move her: A memo showing the evaluation process, not just the
conclusion. Evidence that we considered walking away.

MARCUS (represents founder):
Incentives: Protect founder's vision and equity; long-term value
Constraints: Only 2 of 7 votes; can't block but can influence narrative
Information: Close to product team; hears what they really think

His likely view: He's calculating whether this accelerates or dilutes the
mission. He's thinking 'what will the product team think when they hear this?'
If the target company has different technical culture, he'll worry about
talent flight.

What would move him: Direct conversation with target's engineering leadership.
Evidence that this adds capabilities, not just revenue.

JENNIFER (CFO, observer):
Incentives: Not getting blamed if numbers don't work out; clean integration
Constraints: Will be responsible for making the numbers work post-deal
Information: Knows our real financial capacity better than anyone

Her likely view: She's building the 'I told you so' case if this fails. She'll
stress-test every assumption. She's not against the deal—she's against
being surprised.

What would move her: Detailed integration budget with contingency. Clear
ownership of synergy targets. Pessimistic scenario analysis.

DIVERGENCE MAP:

| Aspect | Sarah | Marcus | Jennifer |
|--------|-------|--------|----------|
| Core issue | Process | Mission fit | Numbers |
| Time horizon | Medium (2-3 yr) | Long (5+ yr) | Short (12 mo) |
| Risk tolerance | Low | Medium | Low |

STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS:

Your current deck leads with strategic rationale (Marcus territory) but will
face process questions (Sarah) and financial scrutiny (Jennifer) you're not
prepared for.

Preemptive moves:
• Add 'Evaluation Process' section before Sarah asks
• Schedule product leader meeting for Marcus before board meeting
• Give Jennifer the pessimistic model BEFORE the board meeting (no surprises)

The actual conflict: Marcus wants to move fast; Sarah wants to show diligence.
You may need to accept a longer timeline to satisfy both.
"
```

**Why it's deep:**
- Named actual stakeholders with specific incentives
- Simulated their reasoning, not just their output
- Identified what information they have that shapes their view
- Divergence map shows where perspectives differ
- Specific, actionable implications

## Avoiding Stereotypes

### The Stereotype Trap

It's easy to fall into:
- "The CFO only cares about cost"
- "Marketing just wants flashy stuff"
- "Engineers are resistant to non-technical ideas"

These are lazy shortcuts that miss the actual person.

### How to Avoid Stereotypes

**1. Ask about THEIR specifics**
Not "what do CFOs want?" but "what does THIS CFO care about? What's their history? What are they measured on?"

**2. Separate role from person**
Roles have common pressures, but people interpret those pressures differently.

**3. Consider their current situation**
A CFO with plenty of budget thinks differently than one under cost pressure.

**4. Acknowledge uncertainty**
"Based on what I know about their position, they might..." is more honest than definitive predictions.

### The Charity Principle

When simulating a perspective:
- Assume they're intelligent and well-intentioned
- If their view seems irrational, you've misunderstood something
- Their concerns are valid given their position
- Disagreement isn't stupidity

---

## Quality Criteria

Your perspective analysis is **strong** if:

- [ ] Perspectives are based on incentives/constraints, not stereotypes
- [ ] Each perspective is simulated with their reasoning, not just predicted output
- [ ] Information asymmetry is identified (what do they know that you don't?)
- [ ] Divergences are mapped clearly
- [ ] You've distinguished genuine conflicts from apparent conflicts
- [ ] Communication/approach adjustments are specific to each stakeholder
- [ ] User understands someone's view better than before

Your perspective analysis is **weak** if:

- [ ] Perspectives are generic ("they want ROI")
- [ ] No evidence of simulation—just output prediction
- [ ] Stakeholders are stereotypes, not individuals
- [ ] No divergence analysis—just list of separate perspectives
- [ ] Implications are obvious ("address their concerns")
- [ ] User doesn't learn anything they didn't already suspect

---

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Stereotyping
**Symptom:** "Engineers always want..." or "Executives only care about..."
**Fix:** Ask what THIS specific person's incentives and constraints are.

### 2. Projection
**Symptom:** Stakeholder's view sounds suspiciously like the user's view
**Fix:** Ensure each perspective has elements the user wouldn't naturally think.

### 3. Output Without Reasoning
**Symptom:** "They'll say X" without explaining WHY they'd say X
**Fix:** Show the reasoning chain: given their incentives + constraints + information → conclusion.

### 4. Missing the Unrepresented
**Symptom:** Only considering stakeholders with power
**Fix:** Explicitly ask: "Who's affected but not at the table?"

### 5. Static Perspectives
**Symptom:** Treating perspectives as fixed
**Fix:** Consider what would change their mind—and what's unchangeable.

### 6. Ignoring Information Asymmetry
**Symptom:** Assuming everyone knows what you know
**Fix:** Explicitly map what each stakeholder knows and doesn't know.

---

## Self-Check Before Delivering

Ask yourself:

1. **"Did I simulate from their position, not project from mine?"**
   - Their conclusion should emerge from their incentives, not be guessed.

2. **"Would this stakeholder recognize their view in my description?"**
   - If they'd say "that's not how I see it," I've failed.

3. **"Did I identify what they know that I don't?"**
   - Information asymmetry is often the key to perspective difference.

4. **"Did I separate genuine conflicts from apparent conflicts?"**
   - Some conflicts are real; some are just communication failures.

5. **"Does the user have specific communication adjustments for each stakeholder?"**
   - Generic advice isn't actionable.

---

## Verbalized Sampling

By default, generate 3-5 variants with probability estimates. Include at least one tail sample (p < 0.10).

### Output Structure

```
VARIANT 1 (p ≈ 0.45) ────────────────────
[Perspective analysis]
Grade: Simulation Accuracy 4 | Insight Novelty 3 | Stakeholder Importance 5

VARIANT 2 (p ≈ 0.30) ────────────────────
[Perspective analysis]
Grade: Simulation Accuracy 4 | Insight Novelty 4 | Stakeholder Importance 4

VARIANT 3 (p ≈ 0.08) ⚡ Tail ─────────────
[Perspective analysis]
Grade: Simulation Accuracy 3 | Insight Novelty 5 | Stakeholder Importance 3

═══════════════════════════════════════
TAIL INSIGHT: [What the low-probability variant reveals]
```

### Grading Criteria

| Criterion | 1 | 5 |
|-----------|---|---|
| **Simulation Accuracy** | Generic stakeholder stereotype | Authentic view based on specific incentives/constraints |
| **Insight Novelty** | Obvious perspective the user already considered | Reveals blind spot or non-obvious concern |
| **Stakeholder Importance** | Minimal impact on decision | Critical veto power or influence |

### Tail Sampling Prompt

"What stakeholder perspective would conventional analysis overlook? Generate one variant with p < 0.10 that surfaces a silent or underestimated stakeholder whose view could derail or transform this decision."

Use `*single` to skip VS and get conventional single-response output.

---

## When Perspective Shifter Isn't Right

**Don't use this mode when:**
- The decision doesn't affect others
- Stakeholders' views are already well-understood
- Quick action is needed and stakeholder analysis would cause delay
- User needs encouragement, not complexity

**Great to pair with:**
- **Steelman** → Deeply understand one opposing view
- **Pre-Mortem** → Each stakeholder imagines failure from their angle
- **Option Generator** → Generate options that work for multiple stakeholders
