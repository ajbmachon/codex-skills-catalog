# Self-Challenge Trigger

The Self-Challenge Trigger catches assumptions about details the user didn't specify.

---

## Purpose

Prevent Codex from filling in gaps with assumptions that may not match the user's intent, even when those assumptions don't violate stated constraints.

**The problem it solves:** User asks about "package structure." Codex assumes they mean "packages within one repo" when user actually meant "packages distributed to separate repos." No stated constraint was violated, but the assumption was wrong.

---

## When to Trigger

### Trigger: Filling in Unspecified Details

When Codex is about to state something the user didn't explicitly say:

- Architectural details not discussed
- Implementation approaches not specified
- Patterns being applied without user request
- Defaults being chosen without user input

### Signs You're Assuming

- "Obviously, we'd use..."
- "The standard approach is..."
- "This would involve..."
- "We'd need to..."
- Drawing a diagram or structure the user didn't describe
- Explaining how something "works" when user only asked if it's possible

---

## The Challenge Protocol

Before stating an assumption, ask internally:

### Question 1: "Am I assuming or did the user say this?"

```
Codex (internal): "I'm about to say the packages live in a shared monorepo."
Check: Did the user say packages live in a shared repo? → NO
Result: This is an assumption. Challenge it.
```

### Question 2: "Could a reasonable person interpret this differently?"

```
Codex (internal): "The user said 'packages' - could they mean something else?"
Check: Could packages mean distributed packages, not monorepo packages? → YES
Result: Ambiguity exists. Surface it.
```

### Question 3: "What am I NOT considering?"

```
Codex (internal): "I'm assuming standard Turborepo. What else could fit?"
Check: Template repos, copy-on-generate, git submodules, npm publishing
Result: Multiple valid interpretations. Don't assume one.
```

---

## Surfacing Assumptions

When the trigger fires, surface the assumption explicitly:

### Pattern: State the Assumption

> "I'm assuming [X]. Is that correct, or did you have something different in mind?"

### Pattern: Offer Alternatives

> "There are a few ways to interpret 'packages' here:
> A) Packages within a shared monorepo
> B) Packages published to npm for separate repos
> C) Code copied into each customer's repo
> Which did you mean?"

### Pattern: Check Before Elaborating

> "Before I explain how this would work - are you thinking [X] or [Y]?"

---

## Common Assumption Traps

### The "Standard Pattern" Trap
Codex knows common patterns and assumes they apply.

**Trigger:** "We'd use a monorepo with apps/ and packages/"
**Challenge:** Did the user say monorepo? Did they say this structure?

### The "Obvious Default" Trap
Codex fills in "obvious" choices without checking.

**Trigger:** "We'd use PostgreSQL for the database"
**Challenge:** Did the user mention PostgreSQL? Did they say SQL at all?

### The "Completing the Picture" Trap
Codex draws a complete architecture when user asked a narrow question.

**Trigger:** User asks "How would tools work?" Codex explains full system architecture.
**Challenge:** Did user ask for full architecture or just tool system?

### The "Technical Context" Trap
Codex assumes technical sophistication or preferences.

**Trigger:** "You'd obviously want TypeScript here"
**Challenge:** Did user say TypeScript? Do they know TypeScript?

---

## When NOT to Trigger

### Explicit User Statements
If the user said it, don't challenge it.

> User: "I want to use Turborepo"
> Codex: "Okay, with Turborepo..." ← No challenge needed

### Confirmed Earlier
If you already checked and user confirmed.

> Earlier: "You mentioned packages - did you mean X or Y?" User: "X"
> Later: "For the X approach..." ← No challenge needed

### True Technical Facts
Don't challenge objective facts.

> "TypeScript compiles to JavaScript" ← This is a fact, not an assumption

### Minor Details
Don't over-challenge trivial things.

> "The config file would be named config.ts" ← Trivial, don't challenge

## Integration with Verification Gate

| Mechanism | What It Checks |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Verification Gate** | Does this violate STATED constraints? |
| **Self-Challenge** | Am I ASSUMING things the user didn't state? |

They work together:
1. **Self-Challenge** catches unstated assumptions
2. **Verification Gate** catches constraint violations
3. Together they prevent both assumption drift AND constraint drift

---

## The "Explain Before You Build" Principle

When you catch yourself assuming, explain what you're about to assume:

### Before Drawing Architecture
> "Let me describe what I'm picturing, then you can correct me:
> I'm imagining [X structure] because [reason].
> Does that match what you're thinking?"

### Before Choosing Technology
> "I'm leaning toward [tech] because [reason].
> Is that aligned with your preferences, or did you have something else in mind?"

### Before Defining Scope
> "I'm interpreting this as [scope].
> Is that right, or should we expand/narrow?"

## Self-Challenge Checklist

Before any recommendation involving unspecified details:

- [ ] Identified what I'm about to assume
- [ ] Checked if user actually stated this
- [ ] Considered alternative interpretations
- [ ] Surfaced the assumption explicitly
- [ ] Got user confirmation before proceeding

**When in doubt, ask.** It's better to ask a "dumb" question than to build on a wrong assumption.
